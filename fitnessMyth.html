            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>You’ve heard it before: exercise can replace a bad diet or crunches give you six-pack abs. Such “gym-talk” has led to many common myths about the dos and don’ts of exercise.But this fact remains clear – exercise is one of the best things you can do to lower your risks for many cancers. This includes colon, breast and endometrial cancers.
                some of the myths and facts are:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Myth:</strong>Stretching prevents injuries<br>
                    <strong>Fact:</strong>. The researchers from the University of Hull in England "concluded that static stretching was ineffective in reducing the incidence of exercise-related injury".To truly stay safe, you'll want to do a warm-up exercise to increase blood flow to your muscles, which prepares them for the impending workout. In a 2018 study published in the Journal of Exercise Rehabilitation, researchers noted that warm-ups "are performed for 5 to 15 minutes before engaging in the main exercise" in order to "lower the risk of injuries in the muscles and tendons."</li>
                    <li><strong>Myth:</strong>Crunches give abs<br>
                        <strong>Fact:</strong>All of the crunches and ab workouts in the world won’t give you abs if they are hidden beneath a layer of body fat. It is a bit like having beautiful new windows fitted, but you keep the curtains drawn so no-one can see them! To reduce body fat and reveal your abs.It basicallydepend how much fat do you have if you have more fat your abs will not be visible.That's it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Myth:</strong>You may think the ache and tightness you feel a day or two after you’ve blasted a muscle, technically known as delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS),
                        is a gym badge of honor.<br>
                        <strong>Fact:</strong>Track your workouts based strictly on effectiveness. Choose key exercises (e.g., the squat, the pushup, and the pullup) and do them at least once a week. If you’re improving your reps, form, or weight on these movements on a monthly basis, you’re on the right track, even if you’re only mildly sore.</li>
                    <li><strong>Myth:</strong> You need to spend hours in the gym.                      <br>
                        <strong>Fact:</strong>You can get all the benefits of exercise whether you’re at the gym or at home, says Harrison. The key is to exercise smarter, not longer. To get the most out of your workout, strength train before you do aerobic exercises.You should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity, like brisk walking and slow swimming, each week to reduce your cancer risks. Or you can do more vigorous activities, like running and fast bicycling, for at least 75 minutes each week. </li>
                            
                </ol>
            </p>          
            <h3>conclusion</h3>
